# Code Review Resources

  - **Action items:** This chronological list of events (i.e., to-dos) provides an overview of the code review process within a typical data science project.

  - **Style guide considerations:** A brief list of suggestions (e.g., conventions for naming, commenting spacing) to help teams adopt a set of coding conventions.

  - **Code Review checklist:** This detailed set of questions (split into four areas of focus: File Organization/Project Management, Documentation/Comments, Algorithms, and Structure + Presentation) acted as a rubric to aid students in conducting code review.

  - **Video example (of using the checklist):** This video served as a tutorial on how to use the Code Review Checklist, highlighting rationale for evaluating criteria laid out in the checklist and promoting code review as more than a bug-finding activity.

With the hope to encourage good code review habits, we’ve created some resources for you all to use in your projects. 

First, we’ve created a list of action items (student-action-items.docx). As you’ve already started work on your projects, it is important to work with your team to:
1)	Create a style guide document with basic formatting rules and naming conventions
  a)	Some ideas for what should be included, along with examples, included in style-guide-considerations.docx
2)	Agree on a basic process for writing code and conducting code review
3)	Designate roles for larger and/or recurring tasks

Once you’ve established some group norms and are working on the scripting portion of your projects, it’s good practice to regularly review your code. We’ve created a checklist that will help identify areas to focus your reviews on (student-checklist.docx). Please be sure to save all of your checklists for each round of code review you complete. There is also a video example of how the checklist might be used (checklist-example-video.mov).
