# Code Review Resources

  - **Action items:** This chronological list of events (i.e., to-dos) provides an overview of the code review process within a typical data science project.

  - **Style guide considerations:** A brief list of suggestions (e.g., conventions for naming, commenting spacing) to help teams adopt a set of coding conventions.

  - **Code Review checklist:** This detailed set of questions (split into four areas of focus: File Organization/Project Management, Documentation/Comments, Algorithms, and Structure + Presentation) acted as a rubric to aid students in conducting code review.

  - **Video example (of using the checklist):** This video served as a tutorial on how to use the Code Review Checklist, highlighting rationale for evaluating criteria laid out in the checklist and promoting code review as more than a bug-finding activity.
